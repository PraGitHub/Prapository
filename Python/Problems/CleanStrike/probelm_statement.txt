A new game in carrom-board called Clean Strike is played by 2 players with multiple turns. A
turn has a player attempting to strike a coin with the striker. Players alternate in taking turns.
The game is described as follows:

? There are 9 black coins, a red coin and a striker on the carrom-board
? Strike - When a player pockets a coin he/she wins a point
? Multi-strike - When a player pockets more than one coin he/she wins 2 points. All, but 2
coins, that were pocketed, get back on to the carrom-board
? Red strike - When a player pockets red coin he/she wins 3 points. If other coins are
pocketed along with red coin in the same turn, other coins get back on to the
carrom-board
? Striker strike - When a player pockets the striker he/she loses a point
? Defunct coin - When a coin is thrown out of the carrom-board, due to a strike, the player
loses 2 points, and the coin goes out of play
? When a player does not pocket a coin for 3 successive turns he/she loses a point
? When a player fouls 3 times (a foul is a turn where a player loses, at least, 1 point),
he/she loses an additional point
? A game is won by the first player to have won at least 5 points, in total, and, at least, 3
points more than the opponent
? When the coins are exhausted on the board, if the highest scorer is not leading by, at
least, 3 points or does not have a minimum of 5 points, the game is considered a draw
